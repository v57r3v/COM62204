Module Code: COM62204 / COM61004 
Synopsis:  This module emphasizes the basic understanding of visual literacy and communication within the current media industries through the comprehension of design elements and principles. It also focuses on the practical application and ethical considerations of the visual aspect in screen and print based visual communication design. The learning and teaching approach for the module will be computer-lab based, by having students to learn and engage in practical tasks in a computer lab environment. As a result, the lecturer is able to have a good view at students’ learning progress during class so that it aligns with the learning outcomes. Prior to every assignment’s submission, two progression checks are carried out to ensure students are on the right track, this serves as a constant review of their works. This module is supported by a combination of classroom practical learning and online learning. The assignments are designed to enable students to gain the knowledge of visual literacy and communication as well as the practical skills needed to achieve the end product.
